In this project you can find the source code for a UiPath Excel library which you can customize and use in your organization. This project supports Windows compatibility. I will also create another project where you can find source code for Legacy compatibility. 
Unfortunately I dont have access to a Legacy environment since I am developing these libraries in a community edition.
I am simultaneously working on a version of this library that doesnt need Excel Handle. You will be able to use that version in conjunction with UiPath excel Scopes. This version of my library unfortunately is not compatible with UiPath excel scopes.
This library is intended for free use of every UiPath customer. Licensing/distribution of this library is not allowed. 
Please reach out to me for issues or feature requests at in/bariskarakas/
I will add more detailed explainations in the upcoming days and more features as we go. For the use of these libraries please see the component workflows under _EXAMPLE_COMPONENTS folder
